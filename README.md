# Dynamic Sanity Check Dashboard with Python Dash and Plotly

## Project Overview

The Dynamic Sanity Check Dashboard is the result of a summer internship project aimed at creating a robust solution for monitoring and managing sanity checks for developers' pull requests. This project utilizes Python, Dash, Plotly, and Pandas to create an interactive and dynamic dashboard that ensures the flashability of pull requests by flashing them to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The dashboard plays a crucial role in monitoring the status of sanity check flashing stations, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the overall process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
  
- **Dash (by Plotly)**: A Python web application framework for creating interactive, web-based dashboards.

- **Plotly**: A graphing library for creating interactive plots and charts.

- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library for Python, used for efficient handling of data.
